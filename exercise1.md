Let's say my team was working on a large-scale piece of software primarily coded in Python. First, we'd decide on a popular linter like flake8 or Ruff to maintain consistent formatting of our code. While Python is a strong typed language, it would probably benefit to use a linter like mypy to enforce typing. Pytest has been a pretty tried and true framework for unit tests that we would establish a TDD environment for. TDD is an important approach to maintaining the usability of the software when packaging new features, because the code is tested even prior to the implementation of the new features.  One very well known alternative to Jenkins or GitHub Actions would be Azure pipelines. It features automatically built tests for bundled projects that it can deliver and has its own version control system with Azure Repos. It also supports running on different systems like Linux, macOS, and Windows in case different members of the team are working on separate operating systems. The decision behind whether we work in a cloud based environment or a self-hosted environment will primarily depend on if we are doing any model rendering. Often times Python based projects will be doing some level or processing (audio or visual) which will require a lot more memory, CPU or GPU power than the offerings of cloud based services.
